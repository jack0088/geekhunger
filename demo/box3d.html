    <h1>Entities</h1>
    <p>When you display many content that all belongs together, you normally "group" this content visually. Box3D is the way to do this.</p>
    <p class="gh-box3d gh-title">All elements can be turned into a box widh a 3d outline via <code>.gh-box3d</code> css-class.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <article class="gh-box3d gh-fullwidth">
        <h1 class="gh-title">And most of the time such a widget will have a title (<code>.gh-title, .gh-title-video, .gh-title-audio</code>) and a media player. Although you can put any other html code inside a widget like this, it is not very common.</h1>
        <h2 class="gh-title-video">This is a <code>.gh-title-video</code></h2>
        <h2 class="gh-title-audio">The only other media-type, that you can use, is <code>.gh-title-audio</code></h2>
        <p>As you can see, the only difference is the icon in front of the title description.</p>
        <p>But these <i><code>.gh-box3d</code></i> elements can also contain other arbitrary content, including all kinds of html markup. There's really no limit! - Although, you should try to fallow the main visual guides of <a href="https://jack0088.github.com/geekhunger" target="_blank" class="gh-hyperlink">Geekhunger</a> as close as you can! This is better for the user experience.</p>
