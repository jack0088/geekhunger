    <h1>Grid</h1>
    <p>Here's a <code>.gh-grid</code> example. Note, that @media-queries are yet missing! And we only have a two-column layout for now (so no happy choosing options for now^^). Also note the outer margin around the grid. All properties are adjustable via css. Still, you are advised to use these css-classes as shown here.</p>
    <p>See how smaller elements try to fill out the holes in the layout? Don't forget that while debugging your script's execution order or something! :)</p>
